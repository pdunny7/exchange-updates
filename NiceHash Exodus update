BitMEX calls itself a trading platform that offers investors access to the global financial markets using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BitMEX was built by finance professionals with more than 40 years of combined experience and offers a comprehensive API. BitMEX is owned by HDR Global Trading Limited.<br /><br />
                In addition to Bitcoin and XBT-USD, BitMEX supports Ether, Tether and ERC-20 coins. BitMEX allows users to stake its own token, BMEX.

                The company boasts low fees, and it says its "sophisticated margin and liquidation process" prevents any user's margin balance from going negative. BitMEX says it stores all Bitcoin in a cold multi-signature wallet. BitMEX stores other assets in hot and cold wallets.

            <h2>What is PancakeSwap?</h2>
            <p>
                PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) with a twist — it runs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and lets users trade BEP-20 tokens and many other digital assets. Launched in 2020, PancakeSwap also allows investors to earn the exchange's native token, CAKE, and liquidity pool tokens. The site offers an <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/nfts/">NFT</a> exchange as well.<br/><br/>
                A DEX is unique because there is no centralized market maker. Instead, users provide liquidity for different crypto assets through liquidity pools. The exchange executes smart contracts which enable swapping of different assets in different pools. The users that provide liquidity, aka liquidity providers, earn rewards as a percentage of the transaction fees in exchange for providing liquidity.<br/><br/>
                CAKE is the native utility token for PancakeSwap. It's mainly used for yield farming, staking, and for <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/voting">governance</a>.  Users can also use CAKE for things like Initial Farm Offerings (IFO) where CAKE gets exchanges for a new token from an early-stage project. Another unique feature of PancakeSwap is lotteries - users can use CAKE to buy tickets to win a large amount of CAKE.<br/><br/>
                PancakeSwap also maintains a <a href="https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/roadmap">public roadmap</a> so you can see what else is being built.<br/><br/>
                With its variety of trading opportunities for DeFi investors, PancakeSwap creates plenty of opportunities for users to make money — and to face <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/blog/crypto-tax-guide">tax liabilities on their crypto activity</a>. CoinTracker can help PancakeSwap users manage and simplify tax reporting.<br/><br/>

            <p>
                PancakeSwap is a DEX and doesn't have a centralized market maker or order book. As a result, it doesn't report transactions to the IRS or provide 1099's or transaction statements. Users can compile transaction data via the exchange's CSV or API tools. Even though PancakeSwap doesn't report directly to tax authorities, users are still responsible for paying taxes on crypto transactions through PancakeSwap.

Similarly, BEP-20 is the specification for creating tokens on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BSC uses a proof of stake authority (POSA) method to verify transactions, which is much cheaper and faster than Ethereum-chain transactions. The criticism levied on BSC/BEP-20 transactions is weaker decentralization. BSC relies on ~20 validators for a block vs. ETH using 70k+ validators.<br/><br/>It's important to note that you cannot transfer BEP-20 tokens into ERC-20 tokens directly. You have to use a Bridge service like <a href='https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bridge'>Binance Bridge</a> to wrap the tokens. This is reversible when you want to un-wrap and send them back to the originating wallet/chain. ",

With over 50,000 users in 4 years, the Yoroi wallet now also supports <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/price/ergo">ERG</a>—<a href="https://ergoplatform.org/en/">Ergo</a>'s native token.<br/><br/>
                Yoroi was created by <a href="https://emurgo.io/">EMURGO</a>—a technology company, providing blockchain solutions for firms, developers, startups, and governments, and one of Cardano's three founding entities.<br/><br/>
                Although the Yoroi wallet is <a href="https://yoroi-wallet.com/">light</a>, users still have access to essential wallet functions, like staking for a chance to earn more crypto and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf">airdrops</a>. Yoroi has also been actively exploring <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/blog/defi-yield-farming-crypto-tax-guide">DeFi</a> solutions for the Cardano ecosystem.<br/><br/>
                Yoroi is a light wallet, which means downloading a full copy of the blockchain isn't necessary for the wallet to work correctly. This makes it super quick for wallet users to verify the reception of transactions.

            <h2>What is Blockchain.com?</h2>
            <p>
                In the early days, <a href="http://blockchain.com/">Blockchain.com</a> was known as <a href="http://blockchain.info/">Blockchain.info</a> and was the very first Bitcoin Blockchain Explorer. Its primary purpose was to keep track of all bitcoin trades.<br></br>
                Asides from this primary role, <a href="http://blockchain.info/">Blockchain.info</a>'s API also gave companies the freedom to build on Bitcoin.<br></br>
                The exchange and wallet provider renamed itself <a href='http://blockchain.com/'>Blockchain.com</a> in 2012 and became one of the biggest crypto-wallet providers, allowing users to hold multiple cryptocurrencies at once.<br></br>
                Blockchain.com recorded over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/">81 million wallet users as of 2022</a> and 84 million wallets created since the platform began operating.<br></br>
                The Blockchain.com Wallet supports several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stacks, Stellar Lumens (XLM), and most ERC-20 tokens.<br></br>
                It also supports major <a href="https://support.cointracker.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413079083153-Decentralized-Finance-DeFi-Guide">DeFi</a> tokens like Polkadot (DOT), Aave (AAVE), and Yearn Finance (YFI). Additionally, a 'Reward Account' feature is available to eligible wallet users, giving them a chance to earn rewards for storing cryptocurrency—but not in the same way as <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/blog/eth2-and-crypto-taxes">staking</a>.<br></br>

                We'll look at how Blockchain.com Wallet transactions are taxed, how to stay on top of tax reports, and how to monitor financial statements.
            </p>
            <h2>How are Blockchain.com transactions taxed?</h2>
            <p>
                How crypto transactions are taxed will depend on factors such as how and when the assets were received and spent. Read our <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/blog/crypto-tax-guide">Crypto tax guide</a> for more.

            <h2>What is Bittrex?</h2>
            <p>
                Bittrex is a Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014. Bittrex stood out as a security-focused centralized exchange, offering 2FA to all users early on. In addition, they employ a multi-wallet strategy such that most crypto assets are stored in cold storage at any given time. Bittrex supports individual and corporate accounts and allows the trading of over 400 cryptocurrencies, including the major ones like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). They also offer a mobile app to view your Bittrex portfolio and trade on the go.<br></br>
                Bittrex has historically been a crypto-to-crypto exchange, although now does support the ability to buy certain crypto assets with fiat, which requires customer verification. They have a <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000199651-Bittrex-fees>fee schedule</a> based on whether you're a maker (creating liquidity on exchange) or taker (reducing liquidity).

            <h2>What is NiceHash?</h2>
            <p>
                NiceHash is a a global cryptocurrency exchange and hash power broker founded by Marko Kobal and Matjaž Škorjanc in 2014. With over <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/nicehash-everything-crypto-in-one-place">2.5 million users</a> (2022), it is one of the largest crypto mining companies in the world.
            <br>
            </br>
                NiceHash allows users to rent out their excess computing power so others can use it to mine cryptocurrencies. Miners selling their computing power receive payments in <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/price/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, while buyers can buy "hash power" to mine the cryptocurrency of their choice. NiceHash's marketplace is an excellent spot for miners to earn money and buyers to get the hash power they need to mine cryptocurrency.
            <br>
            </br>
                NiceHash recently launched a new cryptocurrency exchange platform called <a href="https://www.nicex.com">NiceX</a>. This platform allows users to trade cryptocurrencies using their NiceHash accounts.
            <br>
            </br>
                NiceHash allows its users to:

                    <li>Store, deposit, and withdraw cryptocurrencies
                    <li>Exchange cryptocurrency
                    <li>Buy crypto with EUR, USD, and other fiat currencies
                </ul>
                The platform offers features for both beginners and advanced miners.
                <ul>
                    <li>For beginners — NiceHash provides a simple interface and easy-to-use tools to buy and sell hashing power
                    <li>For advanced miners — NiceHash offers a range of features, including a hash power marketplace, hash rate calculator, API, and profitability switching
                    <li>The hash rate calculator allows you to input your hash rate and power consumption to see how much you earn per day, week, or month
                    <li>The API lets you integrate your NiceHash account with third-party software
                    <li>The profitability switching feature allows you to automatically switch to the most profitable coin at any given time
                </ul>
                NiceHash also offers a range of tools to help miners optimize their earnings. These include a <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator">profitability calculator</a>, a mining pool explorer, and a <a href=https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/how-to-build-a-mining-rig-in-2021-part-1">mining rig builder</a>.

            </p>
            <h2>How are NiceHash transactions taxed?</h2>
            <p>
            Most countries around the world consider cryptocurrency as an asset.
            Cryptocurrency trades are considered taxable events. So if you're making crypto trades, you're liable for <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/blog/crypto-tax-guide">crypto taxes</a>.
            If you're a NiceHash user, your taxes fall into two categories:
            <p>
            <strong>Taxes for mining</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll pay <strong>income tax on mining rewards</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on the fair market value of your mined coins when you receive them</li>
                            <li>At a rate dependent on your income tax bracket</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Taxes for trading</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll pay <strong>capital gains tax on your profit</strong> when you:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sell your mining rewards</li>
                            <li>Trade cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency or fiat</li>
                            <li>Trade cryptocurrency for goods and services</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: Mining tax rates and benefits vary depending on whether you're a <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/blog/how-is-cryptocurrency-mining-taxed">hobbyist or business miner</a>.
            <br>
            </br>
            <strong>If you're a business miner</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can deduct your expenses — like the costs of electricity, hardware, and rented space — from your taxes</li>
                    <li>You'll be subject to an additional 15.3% self-employment tax</li>
                </ul>
            <strong>If you're a hobbyist miner</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll be taxed on any profits without tax benefits</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>What forms does NiceHash provide?</h2>
            <p>
            While NiceHash lets you download your transaction history, it doesn't provide any tax forms, income tax reports, financial statements, or end-of-year statements.
            However, trading on NiceHash is taxable, and it is your responsibility to report your taxes to the relevant tax authorities accurately.
            You can get your transaction history from NiceHash by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Manually exporting it as a CSV file</li>
                    <li>Connecting to any crypto tax software like CoinTracker via API</li>
                </ul>
            At present, Nicehash doesn't report to the IRS, but the IRS and other tax authorities can still track your cryptocurrency transactions. Therefore, you should file your taxes on time to avoid any penalties.
            </p>
            <h2>How does CoinTracker work with NiceHash?</h2>
            <p>
                CoinTracker automatically syncs with NiceHash's API. Connect your account to see your historical transactions and balances.

            <h2>What is Exodus?</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2015, Exodus is a decentralized exchange (DEX) with a portfolio of desktop, mobile, and hardware wallets, supporting over 138 different currencies. It has its headquarters in Nebraska and provides a platform for peer-to-peer trading. As a decentralized exchange, it offers users complete control over their crypto assets. It does not hold their keys, funds, or any personal information about the accounts (meaning users get to be completely anonymous). Some major perks that the exchange offers include:
                <ol>
                    <li>No limits on trading amounts.
                    <li>It can be used on mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
                    <li>It is integrated with Trezor Model T and Trezor One hardware.
                    <li>Users can earn rewards for staking.
                    <li>The latest improvements on the app include integration with NFTs, the Bitcoin Lightning network, and FTX.
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>How are Exodus transactions taxed?</h2>
            <p>
                How crypto transactions are taxed will depend on factors such as how and when the assets were received and spent. Generally speaking, they are subject to capital gains tax. Read our <a href="https://www.cointracker.io/blog/crypto-tax-guide">Crypto tax guide</a> for more.
            </p>
            <h2>What forms does Exodus provide?</h2>
            <p>
                Exodus functions as a decentralized exchange with desktop/mobile wallets and a <a href="https://www.exodus.com/trezor-wallet/">Trezor hardware wallet</a>, so information regarding your keys, transactions, or things as simple as your name are known only to you. Exodus does not collect customer information to provide a tax report and doesn't issue 1099s to users or the IRS. Exodus provides a transaction history file you can upload to CoinTracker to manage your crypto portfolio and get tax statements. The integration steps are described below.

            <h2>How does CoinTracker work with Exodus?</h2>
            <p>
                CoinTracker ingests your entire Exodus transaction history through a custom file upload, anc calculates your capital gains liability from there.
